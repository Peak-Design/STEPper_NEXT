# Modified 2026 by Peak-Design:
#   - Ported to Blender 5.0 API (v2.0.0)
#   - Fixed error in importing files with only single part with tree hierarchy option enabled
#   - Added failed parts popup and import diagnostics
#   - Updated to pythonocc-core 7.9.3 / Python 3.13 for Blender 5.1 (v2.1.0)
#   - Fixed tessellation race conditions and corrupt STEP handling
#   - Added ShapeFix healing for shapes with corrupted/missing geometry
#   - Fixed crash: validate face triangulations before native C++ extraction
#   - Renamed to STEPper NEXT, auto-apply scale, skip empty objects (v2.1.3)
#   - Material database system, multi-user scale fix (v2.2.0)
#   - Migrated OCC bindings from pythonocc-core to OCP (cadquery-ocp-novtk
#     7.9.3.1.1, pybind11); native module reworked to a BinTools serialize
#     handoff, decoupling it from the Python bindings' ABI (v2.3.0)
#   - Modern import dialog with quality presets and unit-aware deflection
#     (physical mm regardless of file units), collection-instances hierarchy
#     mode, construction-geometry filters, per-instance color overrides,
#     import-dialog defaults in preferences (v2.4.0)
#   - SurfaceUV/BoxUV layers, viewport drag & drop, folder batch import,
#     state-preserving Regenerate, Prune/Restore hierarchy, mesh cleanup
#     (v2.4.1)
#   - IGES and BREP import, free-edge curves import, relative (adaptive)
#     tessellation with parallel meshing, pre-import file analyzer with
#     per-machine time estimates (v2.4.2)
#   - Non-blocking background import via a headless-Blender worker process:
#     UI stays responsive, live progress in the status bar, Esc cancels;
#     identical results to the synchronous path (v2.4.3)
#   - Code-review hardening pass (v2.4.4): fixed multi-level Prune/Restore
#     rebuilding inverted; artist-friendly detail slider being silently
#     overridden by the seeded quality preset; batch import ignoring the
#     preference defaults; Regenerate/Reload using the STEP reader for
#     IGES/BREP files; background worker now inherits the user's addon
#     preferences, kills itself if the parent Blender dies, and can no
#     longer hang on a silent worker exit; long CAD material names no
#     longer abort the import; per-label surface color no longer overridden
#     by curve color; edit-mode guards on all mesh tools; cursor-percentage
#     and tooltip/layout polish throughout; CI fail-fast hardening
#   - v2.4.5: parented-empties imports now leave every object (empties
#     included) at scale 1 with the scale baked into meshes; UV generation
#     unified into a single "UVMap" layer with a mode dropdown (None / CAD
#     Surface / Unwrap / Box Project); "Normalize UVs" toggle (off = UVs
#     scaled to real-world units — unwrap islands stay packed and are
#     uniformly rescaled so 1 UV unit ~= 1 scene unit — for consistent
#     texel density across parts); Unwrap mode = packed angle-based unwrap
#     with CAD sharp edges as seams, also honored by Regenerate;
#     engineering material metadata (AP242/AP214 — name/description/density,
#     e.g. from CATIA/NX material assignments) imported as STEP_material*
#     custom properties on every object, plus an "Engineering Materials"
#     option (on by default) assigning one Blender material per part named
#     after the CAD material (feeds the Material Database); "Split Closed
#     Faces" (on by default): UV seams added along the parametric closure
#     of cylinders/cones/tori AND across smooth-joined face groups forming
#     closed tubes/rings (Euler-characteristic test), so unwrapping
#     flattens them cleanly — shading unaffected; import dialog options are
#     remembered across Blender sessions ("Remember import settings"
#     preference, on by default; folder batch import follows them too);
#     Normalize UVs now defaults to off (real-world UV scale); recursive
#     folder batch import; multi-file drag & drop fixed (files list now
#     uses OperatorFileListElement)
