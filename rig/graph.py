No bpy import: this module runs under plain Python in CI. Everything that
can make the generated rig wrong is decided and validated here, before a
single Blender datablock exists. A muted or zero-influence constraint still
counts as a depsgraph dependency in Blender, so a dependency cycle found
here means "do not create the rig", never "create it disabled".

The exporter already cut every graph cycle (SCHEMA.md: loops are pre-cut,
consumers must not re-derive them). This module only verifies the cut is
consistent and turns it into build orders.
