"""Armature construction from a RigPlan, in three strict phases.

Phase 1 (Object mode) creates datablocks, Phase 2 is ONE Edit-mode session
that creates every bone, Phase 3 (Pose mode) configures channels and
constraints. The phases never interleave: an EditBone reference is dead the
moment Edit mode ends, and touching one crashes Blender rather than raising.

Bone convention: local +Y is the joint DOF axis, +Z comes from the
manifest's secondary_axis so roll is deterministic across exports.
